Check out :point_right: [here](https://dvaruas.github.io/sudoku/)

with x-ray mode,,,!!! And some pre-loaded puzzles.

Has Auto-solver powered by **Crook's algorithm**. See details [here](https://www.ams.org/notices/200904/tx090400460p.pdf).

**Caveat :** Crook's algorithm has a provision for random guessing which is not done by us. Guessing would need the solver to solve the board completely to make sure it's guess is correct.
