# Sudoku

Check out the game [here](https://dvaruas.github.io/sudoku/) :point_left:

with x-ray mode...!!! And a few pre-loaded puzzles.

Has Auto-solver powered by **Crook's algorithm** to solve hard puzzles. See details of algorithm [here](https://www.ams.org/notices/200904/tx090400460p.pdf).

**Caveat :** Crook's algorithm has a provision for random guessing which is not done by us. Guessing would need the solver to solve the board completely to make sure it's guess is correct.
